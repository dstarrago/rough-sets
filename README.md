# rough-sets
Rough set class library for machine learning

Features implemented:
- Indiscernibility relations that are the base for classic - and extended rough set relations. 
- Decision systems and space partitions.
- Rough set measures for data set characterization:
  * rough membership
  * rough involvement
  * rough agreement
  * rough class quality
  
Usage: These rough-set measures were used in
